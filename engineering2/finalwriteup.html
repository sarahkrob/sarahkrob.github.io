I chose this game due to the requirement that we use our own engine system, and the fact that the movement provided by the system I created (a physics system) seemed appropriate for the movement of Asteroids, i.e. rotating and slightly drifting movement.</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">In using my existing engine, I did end up having to add a handful of features to it to make it viable with the game of Asteroids. I already had bounds setting as a function, which was very useful for the movement of the player, but I needed to enable asteroids and bullets to move out of bounds and be destroyed, rather than stopped. To allow for that, I added an additional condition to the objects using the system called &ldquo;blocking&rdquo;, which would perform slightly differently when checking bounds, and instead of stopping the object&rsquo;s movement would return a boolean to the game itself so that I could determine what to do with the out-of-bounds object. I additionally had to add the ability to create constant moving objects, without any acceleration, for the bullets and asteroids. This was fairly simple, and just consisted of adding a constant velocity function. Finally, I was unable to implement some of the collision systems created by other students into my game easily due to the fact that my system replaced the rigidbody object we were formerly using, so I had to quickly add in my own collisions. These are not particularly complex and are basically just AABB (axis-aligned bounding box) collisions based on the sizes of the objects, so they don&rsquo;t account for rotation or anything like that, but they serve the purpose I needed-- destroying asteroids and the player on certain collisions. Besides that, I feel like my code was fairly well-equipped to handle the sort of game I made, and I wouldn&rsquo;t really make many changes except for adding these functions in originally rather than in the middle of this project. I would have liked to add more features to the game itself, such as an increased spawning rate to add difficulty and some shaders for the background, but what I have now at least exhibits the functionality.</span></p>

I did run into some trouble regarding getting the audio files to copy correctly that was throwing confusing errors, but he was able to help me out to get it working, and after that it was very easy to use to play sounds for bullets shooting, asteroids being destroyed, etc. I think his system was well-documented and very simple, and required me to know basically nothing about audio-- which is great, because I don&rsquo;t know anything about it! I have nothing I would change about it, except the fact that I had to place audio files in a different folder than I placed the rest of my assets, which I just found a little annoying but not dealbreaking.</span></p>

I believe the goal of the assignments over the course of the semester was to allow us to write cleaner code that can be used easily, such as when we moved meshes and effects into their own classes, when we had to add the ability to read lua files into bin files, and when we had to make sure our own systems for our classmates were well-documented and able to be used very easily. Overall, I think this class helped me to learn how to make more user-friendly systems in my programming. I personally had never really thought much about how outside data provided by designers and users is read in and used in code, so doing that part of the class with the lua files, and hearing about Tony&rsquo;s experience working on the Sims and how they read their data in, was very interesting to me.</span></p>

I don&rsquo;t actually think this is the best approach, as there have been many times when I realize that I need to restructure my programs from the original way I set things up, or that my original way doesn&rsquo;t allow for some functionality I need and would have realized if I plan. However, I just do this because I&rsquo;m a pretty poor planner and prefer to just hop into things-- I&rsquo;ve always been like this, even when writing essays for school (I don&rsquo;t outline them, just jump right in). After this class and working on other projects in this program, I can see how important planning is, and have been trying to do it a bit more by taking notes and writing down a class structure before I start things.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">For me, what makes software architecture &ldquo;good&rdquo; is when it is easy to understand and use. If I have to put hours of work into understanding someone&rsquo;s system, I don&rsquo;t want to use that system, and I will not have a good time implementing it into whatever I need. I encounter this a lot when trying to use libraries I find online that are not well-documented, and also when working with other people&rsquo;s code. At one of my former internships, I was working in an in-house engine that was not documented at all, and was not intuitive to someone who did not have a lot of experience working in engine code, which I did not. Having an understandable software architecture is extremely important to me so that I&rsquo;m not spending half of my time just digging around trying to figure out where things are. This extends to things as simple as naming classes and variables in a helpful way. Another hallmark of good design is when systems are modular, in my opinion-- I don&rsquo;t want a system I&rsquo;m using to rely on another system to be working correctly, as this makes finding the origin of issues difficult. I actually ran into this in a minor way in this class, where a bug I had was actually originating from Graphics, but was crashing my game in Mesh/Effects. To summarize, I think that well-designed software architecture generally does things in a way that&rsquo;s the most understandable to the person using the software, or if not done in the easiest-to-understand way, is documented to explain how it&rsquo;s doing things. I think it should be modular and easy to debug as well, for ease of use. As for badly designed software, I believe it would be incomprehensible to a user who doesn&rsquo;t have extensive pre-existing knowledge of the specific thing it&rsquo;s created for, would require a lot of work to use, and would be poorly documented and hard to debug.</span></p>
