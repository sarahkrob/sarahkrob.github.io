Ideally, what this system would do would be either allowing the user to enter the bounds of an object or use the existing mesh vertices (the latter being more likely) to create objects that are registered with the physics system, having mass. From there, I would like to implement things like gravity, drag, and more elaborate velocity and rotation in order to move the objects around. Ideally, I would like the player to be able to do this with keyboard presses or by clicking and dragging objects with mouse, though the latter will probably be more complex.&nbsp;</span></p>

Methods would be provided for updating position and velocity and so on. This would return either a matrix for the current transform of the object that could be used and submitted to the mesh rendering or a vector for position/rotation etc. that could be used to make said matrix (whichever works best with the currently used matrix implementation). I think, for player use, objects that are created with the physics system are automatically moved by either mouse or keyboard, so the function currently in myGame.cpp that does that would be moved into this library if possible and the player would not have to program in their own velocity changes. As for data files, assuming I just use the existing vertices for the meshes in order to create bodies, no extra information except for maybe a starting position would be needed (some people&rsquo;s files may already include this, mine doesn&rsquo;t).</span></p>

It would require some use of built-in Windows stuff, as far as I&rsquo;m aware. Other difficulties I can foresee would be debugging, as I think a visual debug output would be helpful here, which I don&rsquo;t think is possible, and I typically debug through console logs, which I haven&rsquo;t been able to get to work so far in previous assignments. Without a collision system, there&rsquo;s also no way for objects to interact, which isn&rsquo;t a huge issue since I think implementing more complex physics movement for individual objects will be enough of a challenge (rotation especially, as I&rsquo;ve never implemented rotation from scratch). In terms of stretch goals, assuming I&rsquo;m able to do basic physics implementations, I think implementing some sort of joint system to attach two objects together and have them move in tandem would be fun.</span></p>
