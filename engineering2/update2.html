<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;">For this update, I&rsquo;ve implemented acceleration into my physics system. This means linear movement is now affected by friction, and rotational movement is now affected by a nebulous angular drag number. These are all hard-coded for now, which is something for me to change in the upcoming week. I&rsquo;ve also implemented torque, with the ability for the user to apply a force at a point in the scene and have that affect both the position and rotation of the object. This is what gave me the most trouble, as getting my torque to behave correctly and not make the object rotate infinitely was difficult. I&rsquo;m still not satisfied with my solution to the problem, as it seems a little hacky, but it&rsquo;s temporarily fixed my issue. I&rsquo;d like to look at this further in the next week, and also find a way, if possible, to allow users to click where they&rsquo;d like a force to be applied from, but I have no idea how difficult this might be, as I&rsquo;ve not worked with clicking. Another change is to update my objects&rsquo; moment of inertia value, currently hard-coded, to use values sent in from the mesh of the object to calculate the size of the object. Luckily, no new information should need to be sent for this. There&rsquo;s also some stuff with use of tangents and normals to apply friction that I&rsquo;d like to look into further (I have been extensively in the last few days, but it&rsquo;s very new to me and taking a lot of brainpower to comprehend) but I have no idea if it&rsquo;s worth it given that I&rsquo;m generally satisfied with my current movement, assuming the user will be able to customize it. I also need to test further with different meshes, once my moment of inertia implementation is changed. Basically, I have a lot to do still!</span></p>
