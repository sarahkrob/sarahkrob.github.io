Built in Unreal using C++ and blueprints. Contributions primarily include work on the AI central to the game and how it interacts with the player in regards to both sight in different lighting scenarios and hearing on different floor materials. Additionally worked on AI interactions with the player's ability to hide and be discovered, player interaction with realistically-moving doors, as well as puzzle programming and sound implementation. <a href="https://ottercide.itch.io/villa-de-la-muerte">Download here.</a></h5>
