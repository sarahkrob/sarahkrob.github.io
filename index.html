This project showcases several non-photorealistic rendering techniques meant to imitate various artistic and technical styles. Cel-shading, the Gooch method of technical shading, edge drawing and procedural and texture-based hatching are all shown. All shading techniques were carried out in the fragment shader, apart from edge drawing which was done with a two-pass technique and partially carried out in the main loop and vertex shader as well.
